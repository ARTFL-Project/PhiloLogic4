                PhiloLogic4's query syntax has 5 basic operators:
				<ol style="list-style-position: inside; margin-top: 10px; padding-left: 15px;">
					<li>the plain token, essentially, any word at all, split on space, e.g. <span class="code-block">token</span></li>
					<li>the quoted token--a string in double quotes, which may contain a space, e.g. <span class="code-block">"token"</span></li>
					<li>the range--two tokens separated by a dash, e.g. <span class="code-block">a-f</span></li>
					<li>boolean OR, represented grep-style as <span class="code-block">|</span>, e.g. <span class="code-block">token | word</span></li>
					<li>boolean NOT, represented SQL-style as <span class="code-block">NOT</span>, e.g. <span class="code-block">token.* NOT tokens</span></li>
				</ol>
				
				This syntax is the same, but interpreted slightly differently, for the two different types
				of text query fields: word search and metadata search.  
				
				<h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">Word Searches</h4>
				Full-text word search is unique in having the concept of a "term", which is either a single plain/quoted term, 
				or a group of plain/quoted terms joined by <span class="code-block">|</span>, optionally followed by <span class="code-block">NOT</span>
				and another term-like filter expression:
				<ol style="list-style-position: inside; margin-top: 10px; padding-left: 15px;">
					<li>plain terms are evaluated without regard to accent.  They are currently sensitive to case, to allow for named entity 
					search--this is currently implemented only for Greek, however. Regexes are permitted.</li>
					<li>quoted terms are case and accent sensitive.  Regexes are permitted.</li>
					<li>the range is not operational. In the future, stub this out to make hyphenated search terms less of a pain to escape.</li>
					<li><span class="code-block">OR</span> can conjoin plain and quoted tokens, and precedes evaluation of phrase distance.</li>
					<li><span class="code-block">NOT</span> is a filter on a preceding term, but cannot stand alone: <span class="code-block">a.* NOT abalone</span>
					is legal, <span class="code-block">NOT a.*</span> is illegal</li>
				</ol>
				
				<h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">Metadata Searches</h4>
				
				Metadata search does not support phrases, but supports more sophisticated Boolean searching:
				<ol style="list-style-position: inside; margin-top: 10px; padding-left: 15px;">
					<li>plain tokens separated by spaces have an implied AND between them, but are treated as position-independent tokens.</li>
					Regexes are permitted, but will not span over the bounds of a token.
					<li>quoted tokens must now match against the ENTIRE metadata string value in the database, including spaces and punctuations.</li>
					It will not match a single term within a larger string, no matter how precise. Regexes are permitted
					<li>range allows for numeric and string ranges on all metadata fields.</li>
					<li><span class="code-block">OR</span> can still be used to conjoin plain tokens, preceding the implied Boolean AND, as well as quoted tokens.</li>
					<li><span class="code-block">NOT</span> is still available as both a filter, or a stand-alone negation: <span class="code-block">contrat NOT social</span>
					is legal, so is <span class="code-block">NOT rousseau</span></li>
				</ol>
				
				<h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">Regexp syntax</h4>
				
				Basic regexp syntax, adapted from the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/manual/html_node/find_html/egrep-regular-expression-syntax.html#egrep-regular-expression-syntax">egrep regular expression syntax</a>:
				<ol style="list-style-position: inside; margin-top: 10px; padding-left: 15px;">
					<li>The character <span class="code-block">.</span> matches any single character except newline.</li>
					<li>Bracket expressions can match sets or ranges of characters: <span class="code-block">[aeiou]</span> or <span class="code-block">[a-z]</span>,
					but will only match a single character unless followed by one of the quantifiers below.</li>
					<li><span class="code-block">*</span> indicates that the regular expression should match zero or more occurrences of the previous character or bracketed group.</li>
					<li><span class="code-block">+</span> indicates that the regular expression should match one or more occurrences of the previous character or bracketed group.</li>
					<li><span class="code-block">?</span> indicates that the regular expression should match zero or one occurrence of the previous character or bracketed group.</li>
				</ol>
				Thus, <span class="code-block">.*</span> is an approximate "match anything" wildcard operator, rather than the more traditional (but less precise)
				<span class="code-block">*</span> in many other search engines.
