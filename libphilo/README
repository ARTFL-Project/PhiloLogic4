As of June 2012, PhiloLogic 4 has now entered alpha testing. 
It should compile and install reasonably well,
but should not be expected to be feature or documentation complete.
Note that this repository only contains the library code.
See the related PhiloLogic4-Templates repo for a "soup to nuts" web app framework.

C Dependencies: 
gdbm - installed to your standard INCLUDE path [Mac users see :http://macosx.com/forums/unix-x11/257664-compile-gdbm.html]
  [Also note that the /usr/local/ directory is often not included in default compiler lookups.  
   If your gdbm lives there, either add it to your search path in the environment or as a compiler flag, as described below.]

Python Dependences:
2.6 and below: ElementTree 1.3alpha: http://effbot.org/zone/elementtree-13-intro.htm
2.7 and greater: None

Installation instructions:
make
sudo make install

Due to an absence of a configuration script, 
you can supply non-standard compiler arguments to the make commands.  For example, 
'make LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib/'.

After installation, philologic will have installed:
low-level search executables to /bin/
PhiloLogic python library to your standard python path, according to distutils.

To get started loading documents, please install the PhiloLogic4-Templates package.
